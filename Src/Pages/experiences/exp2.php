            <p>Spend 4 nights in Rome, 3 in Florence and 2 in Venice in this Italian adventure complete with private transfers and first-class rail between cities.
                With nine nights in Rome, Florence, and Venice, guests can immerse themselves in some of Italy’s richest history and most alluring landscapes. Rome is home to thousands of years of culture, art, and architecture, and boasts such sites as St. Peter’s Basilica, the Roman Forum, and the Trevi Fountain. In Florence, they can climb to the top of the red-roofed Duomo or stroll across the medieval Ponte Vecchio—the city’s oldest bridge spanning the Arno River. After three nights spent browsing the stalls of Florence’s Mercato Centrale and the masterpieces of the Galleria dell’Accademia, guests are off to Venice for the remainder of the vacation. Here they can tour the Doge’s Palace, explore the exhibits of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, or watch the sunset from the romantic Rialto Bridge.
